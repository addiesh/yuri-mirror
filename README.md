# The Yuri Shader Language

[![crates](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yuri-lang.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/yuri-lang)

This repository is home to the Yuri shader compiler, including the CLI frontend and the Rust library backend.

Yuri is not done yet, not even close. Neither the design nor implementation are set in stone as this is being written.
As such, please don't expect a finished product anytime soon.
