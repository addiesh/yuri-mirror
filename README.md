# The Yuri Shader Language

This repository is home to the Yuri shader compiler, including the CLI frontend and the Rust library backend.

## Notes

- We intend to create C-family bindings for the compiler API, but this is not a priority.
- We are not on crates.io yet (and we know that a crate called `yuri` exists)
